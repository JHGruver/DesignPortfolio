### 2. Marketing Experts Review

#### Jennifer Thompson - Personal Branding

**Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent: "Compassionate Design" is a STRONG differentiator
- ✅ Good: CDO title prominently displayed
- ⚠️ Critical Issue: **Unclear availability/positioning**
- ❌ Missing: Thought leadership hub
- ❌ Missing: Lead capture mechanism

**Recommendations:**

**CRITICAL - DO IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **Add "How I Can Help" section to hero:**
   ```html
   <section class="services">
     <h2>I Partner With Organizations In 3 Ways:</h2>

     <div class="service-cards">
       <div class="card">
         <h3>🎯 Fractional CDO</h3>
         <p>Strategic design leadership for growing companies.
         8-16 hours/week, equity + retainer.</p>
         <a href="#contact">Book Discovery Call</a>
       </div>

       <div class="card">
         <h3>🚀 Product Design Consulting</h3>
         <p>0-1 product builds, redesigns, AI product UX.
         Project-based or monthly retainer.</p>
         <a href="#contact">Discuss Your Project</a>
       </div>

       <div class="card">
         <h3>🎓 Advisory & Mentorship</h3>
         <p>Design org building, hiring, process.
         Quarterly advisory board role.</p>
         <a href="#contact">Learn More</a>
       </div>
     </div>
   </section>
   ```

2. **Rewrite hero headline:**
   ```
   Current: "Crafting User-Centered Experiences That Drive Results"

   Option A: "Design Leadership That Drives Business Results | CDO Available for Strategic Partnerships"

   Option B: "11 Years Building Products. Now Building Teams. | Fractional CDO & Design Consultant"

   Option C: "From $250K Funded Startups to 30M+ User Products | Your Fractional Chief Design Officer"
   ```

3. **Add social proof section (PROMINENT):**
   ```
   "Trusted By" logo bar:
   - 42robotsAI (current)
   - Jaguar Land Rover
   - Boeing
   - Invisalign
   - Previous companies
   ```

4. **Create thought leadership hub:**
   ```
   "Insights" or "Writing" section:
   - Link to Medium articles
   - Featured blog posts
   - "Subscribe to my newsletter" CTA
   - Topics: AI design, compassionate design, design leadership
   ```

5. **Lead magnet creation:**
   ```
   Offer downloadable resource:
   - "The Compassionate Design Framework" (PDF)
   - "CDO Hiring Guide" (for companies)
   - "AI Product Design Checklist"

   Capture email in exchange
   ```

**BRAND VOICE ADJUSTMENT:**

Current tone is approachable and humble. For executive positioning, add confidence:

❌ "I'm passionate about compassion in design"
✅ "I've spent 11 years proving that compassionate design drives measurable business results"

❌ "I love creating experiences"
✅ "I build products that generate revenue and design teams that scale them"

**PRIORITY: 🔴 CRITICAL** - Positioning confusion loses opportunities

#### David Kim - SEO & Content Strategy

**Findings:**
- ✅ Domain name is strong (jacobgruver.design)
- ⚠️ Single-page design severely limits SEO potential
- ❌ Likely missing technical SEO (need to inspect code)
- ❌ No blog content visible on main site
- ❌ No keyword optimization apparent

**Recommendations:**

**TECHNICAL SEO AUDIT NEEDED:**
Without inspecting the HTML, I suspect these are missing:
```html
<!-- Likely missing: -->
<meta name="description" content="...">
<meta property="og:title" content="...">
<meta property="og:description" content="...">
<meta property="og:image" content="...">
<link rel="canonical" href="...">

<!-- Need to add structured data: -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Jacob Gruver",
  "jobTitle": "Chief Design Officer",
  "url": "https://www.jacobgruver.design",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgruver",
    "https://medium.com/@jacobgruver"
  ],
  "knowsAbout": ["UX Design", "UI Design", "Design Leadership"],
  "alumniOf": "...",
  "award": "..."
}
</script>
```

**STRUCTURAL SEO FIXES:**

1. **Convert to multi-page architecture:**
   ```
   Current: Single page with anchor links

   Better:
   ├── / (homepage)
   ├── /about
   ├── /case-studies
   │   ├── /case-studies/hyper-prompts
   │   ├── /case-studies/cloudcar
   │   ├── /case-studies/atticus
   ├── /services (new)
   ├── /insights (blog)
   └── /contact
   ```

   **Why:** Each page can rank for different keywords

2. **Keyword targeting strategy:**
   ```
   Homepage:
   - Primary: "Chief Design Officer consultant"
   - Secondary: "UX designer Austin", "fractional CDO"

   Case Studies:
   - "AI product design case study"
   - "Automotive UX design"
   - "Healthcare app design"

   Blog Posts (to create):
   - "How to hire a Chief Design Officer"

   ```

3. **Content creation plan:**
   ```
   Month 1:
   - Write 3 pillar blog posts (2000+ words each)
   - Create case study detail pages
   - Add FAQs page

   Month 2:
   - 2 more blog posts
   - Guest post on design blog (get backlink)
   - Update portfolio with new project

   Month 3:
   - Launch newsletter
   - Repurpose content for LinkedIn
   - Submit to design directories
   ```

4. **Image SEO:**
   ```
   All images need:
   - Descriptive filenames: hero-jacob-gruver-cdo.jpg
   - Alt text: "Jacob Gruver, Chief Design Officer and UX Designer"
   - WebP format for performance
   - Proper sizing/compression
   ```

5. **Performance optimization:**
   ```
   Target scores:
   - Google Lighthouse: 90+ (all categories)
   - Core Web Vitals: All green
   - Mobile-friendly test: Pass
   - Page load time: <3 seconds
   ```

**QUICK WINS (This Week):**
1. Add meta descriptions to all pages
2. Create XML sitemap
3. Submit to Google Search Console
4. Add structured data (Person schema)
5. Optimize images (compress, WebP)
6. Add alt text to all images

**CONTENT STRATEGY:**

**Blog Post Ideas (High SEO Value):**
1. "From Designer to CDO: My 11-Year Journey" (personal brand)
2. "How to Evaluate Design Leader Candidates" (targets hiring managers)
3. "Compassionate Design: What It Is and Why It Matters" (thought leadership)
4. "Designing AI Products: 7 Unique UX Challenges" (timely/relevant)
5. "The ROI of Design: Making the Business Case to Executives" (B2B value)

**PRIORITY: 🔴 CRITICAL** - Without SEO, site is invisible

#### Rachel Cohen - Social Media & Growth

**Findings:**
- ✅ Good: Social links present (LinkedIn, Medium)
- ⚠️ Issue: Social proof not leveraged for virality
- ❌ Missing: Shareability features
- ❌ Missing: Social media content strategy

**Recommendations:**

**MAKE IT SHAREABLE:**

1. **Add social sharing for case studies:**
   ```html
   <div class="share-buttons">
     <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check out this case study...">
       Share on X
     </a>
     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=...">
       Share on LinkedIn
     </a>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Create snackable content from case studies:**

   For Hyper Prompts project, create:
   - Before/after image (Instagram/LinkedIn)
   - "How I secured $250K funding through design" (LinkedIn post)
   - Process GIF (Twitter)
   - Design decision breakdown (carousel post)
   - Client testimonial quote card

   Each links back to portfolio

3. **Portfolio launch strategy:**
   ```
   Week 1: Soft launch
   - Post on LinkedIn: "After 6 months, my portfolio is live..."
   - Share in design communities (Designer Hangout, ADPList)
   - Email to network

   Week 2: Case study series
   - Day 1: CloudCar story (30M vehicles!)
   - Day 3: Hyper Prompts funding journey
   - Day 5: Atticus healthcare UX

   Week 3: Thought leadership
   - Publish blog post
   - Share on Medium
   - Cross-post to LinkedIn

   Week 4: Engagement
   - Host LinkedIn Live Q&A
   - "Ask me anything about design leadership"
   - Offer free portfolio reviews
   ```

4. **Content atomization example:**

   Take ONE case study (Hyper Prompts) and create:
   - 1 LinkedIn article (long-form)
   - 5 Instagram posts (visual process)
   - 10 tweet-length insights
   - 1 YouTube walkthrough (if comfortable)
   - 3 design principle graphics
   - 1 podcast interview topic

   = 20+ pieces of content from one project

5. **Community building:**
   ```
   Start "Compassionate Design" movement:
   - Create hashtag #CompassionateDesign
   - Weekly tips on LinkedIn
   - Free monthly "office hours"
   - Build email list with insights
   - Eventually: paid community or course
   ```

**VIRAL HOOKS:**
- "$250K funded through thoughtful design" (success story)
- "11 years, 50+ products, here's what I learned" (experience)
- "Why compassion is your competitive advantage" (contrarian)
- "From Austin to 30M vehicles worldwide" (scale)

**PRIORITY: 🟡 MEDIUM** - Amplifies reach after core fixes

### 3. Product Owner Recommendations

#### Michael Zhang - Hiring Manager Perspective

**Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent: Metrics are present ($250K, 30M vehicles, $140K)
- ✅ Good: Clear role progression (Designer → Head → CDO)
- ⚠️ Issue: Team size/leadership scope unclear
- ❌ Missing: Stakeholder management examples
- ❌ Missing: Failure/learning stories

**Recommendations:**

**FOR EACH CASE STUDY, ADD:**

1. **Role & Scope section:**
   ```markdown
   ## My Role

   **Title:** Lead Product Designer → Head of Design
   **Team:** 3 designers (2 junior, 1 mid), 5 engineers, 2 PMs
   **Timeline:** January 2023 - July 2023 (6 months)
   **Stakeholders:** CEO, CTO, 3 investors, 50+ users
   **Budget:** $150K design/dev budget
   ```

2. **Collaboration section:**
   ```markdown
   ## Cross-Functional Collaboration

   - Facilitated weekly design critiques with engineering
   - Presented design strategy to board of directors (3 times)
   - Ran 5 user research sessions with target customers
   - Aligned product roadmap with CEO and product team
   - Managed design system adoption across 2 product teams
   ```

3. **Challenges & Trade-offs:**
   ```markdown
   ## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

   **Challenge:** Users wanted X feature, but engineering capacity limited
   **Decision:** Implemented Y workaround that achieved 80% of value
   **Result:** Shipped 2 months earlier, validated hypothesis

   **Challenge:** CEO wanted flashy UI, users needed simplicity
   **Decision:** A/B tested both approaches
   **Result:** Simple design won with 23% higher conversion
   ```

4. **Lessons Learned:**
   ```markdown
   ## What I'd Do Differently

   - Should have involved engineering earlier in discovery
   - Underestimated technical debt from legacy system
   - Next time: build design system from day one, not retroactively
   ```

**RED FLAGS TO AVOID:**
- ✅ Good: You show metrics (many portfolios don't)
- ✅ Good: Real companies mentioned (not all fake projects)
- ⚠️ Add: More process/thinking, less final polish
- ⚠️ Add: Team leadership examples

**PRIORITY: 🔴 HIGH** - Leadership proof needed for CDO/senior roles

---

#### Elena Rodriguez - Product Strategy

**Findings:**
- ✅ Good: Business impact clearly stated
- ✅ Good: Multiple industries shown
- ⚠️ Issue: Product thinking not explicitly demonstrated
- ❌ Missing: Data-driven decision making examples
- ❌ Missing: Product roadmap influence

**Recommendations:**

**ADD "PRODUCT THINKING" SECTION TO CASE STUDIES:**

1. **Discovery & Validation:**
   ```markdown
   ## Discovery Process

   **Problem Hypothesis:**
   "Users struggle to compare 30+ AI tools, wasting 10+ hours/week"

   **Validation:**
   - Interviewed 25 potential users
   - Analyzed 12 competitor tools
   - Identified gap: no curation, just aggregation

   **Key Insight:**
   "Users don't want more information, they want better decisions"
   ```

2. **Metrics & Success Criteria:**
   ```markdown
   ## How We Measured Success

   **North Star Metric:** Time to find right AI tool
   **Leading Indicators:**
   - Search-to-result time: <30 seconds (achieved 18s)
   - Tool comparison rate: 3+ tools per session
   - Return user rate: 40% within 7 days (achieved 47%)

   **Business Metrics:**
   - MRR: $0 → $12K in 6 months
   - Customer acquisition cost: $45 (below $60 target)
   - NPS: 62 (promoter-heavy)
   ```

3. **Product Roadmap Influence:**
   ```markdown
   ## Strategic Decisions I Drove

   - Advocated for mobile-first (60% of traffic)
   - Pushed back on feature bloat (kept MVP focused)
   - Prioritized API integration over manual updates
   - Introduced freemium model vs. immediate paywall

   Result: Faster time to market, validated with real users
   ```

4. **AI Product Design (UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR):**

   Since you're CDO at AI company, create separate section:

   ```markdown
   # Designing for AI Products

   ## Unique Challenges I've Solved:

   1. **Explainability:** How to show AI reasoning without overwhelming users
   2. **Trust:** Building confidence in AI recommendations
   3. **Fallback:** Designing for when AI fails or is uncertain
   4. **Training:** Gathering user feedback to improve models
   5. **Ethics:** Transparent about limitations and biases

   [Show examples from your work]
   ```

**COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:**
Most designers show execution. You should show strategy + execution + business impact.

**PRIORITY: 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH** - Differentiates for product-led companies

#### James Mitchell - Technical Product Owner

**Findings:**
- ✅ Good: Technical skills listed (HTML, CSS, JS, React)
- ✅ Good: Portfolio itself is well-built
- ⚠️ Issue: Technical depth not demonstrated in case studies
- ❌ Missing: Design-engineering collaboration examples

**Recommendations:**

1. **Show Technical Constraints in Case Studies:**
   ```markdown
   ## Technical Considerations

   **CloudCar Challenge:**
   - Had to work within automotive-grade Linux constraints
   - 800x480 screen resolution (non-standard)
   - Resistive touchscreen (not capacitive like smartphones)
   - 3-second boot time requirement

   **Design Solution:**
   - Larger touch targets (60px minimum vs. standard 44px)
   - High contrast UI for sunlight readability
   - Offline-first architecture
   - Simplified interactions for driver safety
   ```

2. **Add Developer Handoff Examples:**
   ```markdown
   ## Design System Implementation

   - Created design tokens (JSON format)
   - Documented component specs for React
   - Built Storybook with all states/variants
   - Collaborated with engineers on API structure

   Result: 90% design QA pass rate (vs. 60% industry avg)
   ```

3. **Link to GitHub (if applicable):**
   - Show code contributions
   - Open source design tools you've built
   - Portfolio source code

**PRIORITY: 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM** - Nice differentiator but not essential

### 4. Investor & Business Strategy Review

#### Victoria Blackwell - VC Perspective

**Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent: Startup experience clear (Hyper Prompts, 42robotsAI)
- ✅ Good: Funding secured mentioned ($250K)
- ⚠️ Issue: Co-founder role at 42robotsAI not emphasized enough

   ## From Designer to Founder

   - Hired and scaled design team from 0 to X

   - Limited budget → maximum impact design

   - Fundraising → investor-ready prototypes

   Services:
   - Design partner (equity + small cash)
   - Fundraising deck design

   - Bring data, not just aesthetics
   - Balance user needs with business constraints
   - Partner, don't just execute

   ## My Design Principles

   1. Compassion is strategic, not soft
   2. Systems over one-offs
   3. Designed with, not for
   4. Ship and learn fast
   5. Design serves the business (and vice versa)
   ```

4. **Resume/CV download:**
   ```html
   <a href="/downloads/Jacob-Gruver-Resume-2025.pdf" class="btn">
     Download Resume (PDF)
   </a>
   ```

**EXECUTIVE RED FLAGS TO AVOID:**
- ❌ Typos or grammar issues (proofread 10x)
- ❌ Outdated information
- ❌ Broken links
- ❌ Too casual (while compassion is your brand, maintain professionalism)

**THE LITMUS TEST:**
"Could a board of directors review this before hiring you as CDO?"

**PRIORITY: 🔴 CRITICAL** - Executive positioning = higher-value opportunities

## Risk Assessment

### What Happens If You Don't Update?

**Short-term (3-6 months):**
- Miss high-value opportunities (founders/VCs don't understand availability)
- Get contacted for wrong roles (IC positions vs. leadership)
- Lower conversion rate (visitors leave confused)

**Medium-term (6-12 months):**
- Competitors with better positioning win contracts
- Google ranking stagnates (no SEO = no organic traffic)
- Network assumes you're not available (CDO = fully employed)

**Long-term (12+ months):**
- Portfolio becomes outdated (projects age poorly)
- Thought leadership opportunity lost (someone else becomes "compassionate design" expert)
- Revenue opportunity cost: $100K-500K in missed contracts

**Risk Level:** 🔴 HIGH - Current site doesn't support your business goals

## Expert Team Final Thoughts

### From the Team:

**Dr. Sarah Chen (UX):** "You have the substance. Now match it with structure."

**Jennifer Thompson (Marketing):** "Compassionate design is brilliant positioning. Double down on it."

**Michael Zhang (PM/Hiring):** "I'd interview you based on metrics alone. Show me more leadership stories and you're hired."

**Victoria Blackwell (VC):** "Co-founder + CDO is powerful. Don't hide it. Startups need this combo."

**Samantha Lee (Recruiter):** "You're one 'Work With Me' page away from $200K opportunities."

**David Kim (SEO):** "Beautiful site that no one can find is worthless. Fix SEO first."

**Thomas Anderson (Ex-CDO):** "I made these same mistakes. Learn from mine: be clear about availability and pricing."

### Consensus:

Your portfolio has **excellent foundation** but **critical positioning gaps**.

**The good news:** These are all fixable in 2-4 weeks.

**The opportunity:** Most senior designers don't do this work. You can dominate your niche.

**The urgency:** Every week without these fixes is lost opportunity cost.
